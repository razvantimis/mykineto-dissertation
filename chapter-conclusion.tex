\par Proposed system for the tracking of the posture doesn\mbox{'}t perform as we originally expected.
\par There seems to be some problems regarding the determination of the bounding box, maybe due to the fact that the detected points are on a surface that is characterized by just a few colors that appear in almost all tracked region. Because of these characteristics of the tracked posture we fail to track enough points due to insufficient difference in the nearest proximity of a point. 

\par For future development we will try to adapt described system to track the contours.

\par Even if posture tracking system doesn\mbox{'}t perform as we expected, we succeeded in the finding the appropriate settings for the PoseNet so that it performs enough good for the determination of the ranges of motion. Based on these calculations we were able to count, in real time, the number of exercises that user made.
